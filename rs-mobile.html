      <p>
        At Rackspace, there came a time where we had to completely reimagine our
        apps visual identity, pivoting our look and feel to be more consistent
        with what our customers' relationship with the online web portals tend
        to be. This was an opportunity to take what was already there and
        fine-tune it for a more satisfying experience.
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Role:</span> Lead Experience &amp; Interface
          Designer
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Platforms:</span> Mobile Android &amp; iOS
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Project Length:</span> May - July 2018 (3
          Months)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        An Infrastructure Manager is skeptical about using the app because they
        have never seen a blue Rackspace product and it's cumbersome to use.
        However, they need a way to analyze environment status on-the-go, for
        when critical or unforeseen situations occur.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers can't tell if they're using the correct app</li>
        <li>Low awareness and adoption</li>
        <li>Individual branding and iconography</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Color Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Research revealed that having unrelated branding gave the perception
        that customers are using the wrong app. With a design system in place, I
        developed a mobile library to unite our mobile presence with our online
        portals.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        The majority of the layout and flow are almost identical. Yet, there
        were inconsistencies between tasks that were ripe to tidy up. For
        example, ‘Monitoring’ made use of 3 categories (originally, only
        represented by an icon) for different levels of status. Meanwhile,
        ‘Severs’ simply placed all instances in a single list relying only on
        the use of color to differentiate their current health.
      </p>

      <p>
        In efforts to improve the experience where it would require a minimal
        level of effort from engineering, I did the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduce ambiguity and reinforce the meaning of icons by including
          labels
        </li>
        <li>
          Positioning status icons next to the items that they were specific to.
          This allows users the affordance to not have to rely on color alone to
          convey the condition
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide ‘Servers’ into a similar segmented architecture so that one
          could view and manage tasks more quickly
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In most cases, I delivered a no-change scenario that was supported by an
        alternate solution that I advocated would enhance the usability and
        overall experience but would require buy-in from our development and
        product stakeholders. Our ‘Monitoring’ and ‘Server’ features are perfect
        examples of going to battle for our customers, and in the end, the
        revised solutions made the most sense and were implemented.
      </p>

        “Did you know, that 4.5% of the global population experience color
        blindness? That’s 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women!”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Consistency</h2>
      <p>
        Our customers also have a need to create resources and communications
        while on the go. Previously, these tasks were thought about individually
        and handled much differently. However, opting for a reimagined
        experience that was consistent for all situations where a user would
        need to create something new, there is now a refactored step by step
        flow.

      </div>

      <h2>Communications</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most important features of the Rackspace App are Tickets
        followed by Notifications. Here, users can view their tickets, see any
        activity that requires attention, awareness of alerts or monitoring
        status they have enabled, along with the ability to respond directly to
        a Rackspace support tech or generate a new support ticket to get
        assistance with right away.

      <p>
        This was a big challenge because this would require implementing a new
        backend API which would handle the user flow much differently. Also
        because the mobile design is always limited on space. To achieve this, I
        revised the date/time stamp pattern so that it would be consistent. Made
        sure that subjects and comments were truncated after a maximum of 2
        lines each. Then, I added an indicator that would tell users which
        tickets need attention, just like they would see on the web portal.
      </p>

      <h2>Icons &amp; Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the screen redesigns, updating the iconography in the app
        was another task necessary to tackle and bring consistency and clarity
        to their meanings. I had help from another designer on my team to help
        document and analyze all of the differences. Let’s take a closer look at
        how this was achieved in our navigation.

        They are as follows: Monitoring, Servers, Tickets, Notifications, and
        Support
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Monitoring: </span>This was probably the icon
          that needed the least amount of work, however, Rackspace had several
          different icons in use for this. Using a heart reference didn’t seem
          to make a lot of sense to our users in terms of IT devices so going
          with a simple pulse instead would still communicate ‘health’ but not
          necessarily human health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Servers: </span>Our UI library designers
          worked incredibly hard to come up with a few standard system icons to
          working inside our portal so no need to recreate a visual that our
          users were already familiar with. This one’s a keeper =)
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Tickets: </span>Yes! The movie ticket is a
          pretty universal indicator to communicate, well, tickets. However, our
          customers favored an icon that was designed and already in use within
          our web UI. So, again this one remains unchanged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Notifications: </span>Somehow we had two
          different types of bell designs in production for each platform.
          Therefore, we used the design system asset and updated the icon to
          ensure consistency across all interfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Support: </span>Lastly, our design system had
          a published support version in use and implemented on the web, so a
          simple swap makes for coherence in our mobile navigation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Short. Sweet. Big difference!</p>
      <p>
        Since the release of this update, we saw a significant increase in total

        & Feel.
