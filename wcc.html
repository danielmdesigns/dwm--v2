    <h2>Project brief</h2>
    <p>I was invited to help rebrand Waterloo Counseling Center for their upcoming 30th Year Anniversary. Waterloo
      supports the mental health and well-being of all Central Texans by providing affordable individual, group, and
      family counseling with an expertise in gender, sexual, and cultural diversity. Their ultimate goal is to make
      people feel welcomed, accepted and empowered.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Our mission was to produce a fresh, modern brand identity for Waterloo. Requirements consisted of a new identity
      encompassing a recognizable triangle inside the "W". This represents guiding an individual on a journey, while the
      purple triangle speaks to Waterloo’s LGBT friendliness. A simplified color strategy was also implemented to appeal
      to all people regardless of nation, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. An added benefit included becoming more
      cost-effective by avoiding the high price of full color printing due to their current rainbow gradient scheme.</p>

    <h2>Logo Design</h2>
    <p>My focus was on initial design and conception for the logomark. We first started with word mapping and basic
      desired requirements. From there, we built mood boards sharing shapes, textures, patterns, and other ideas that I
      found with our team. Afterwards, I began sketching and drawing as many iterations as possible. Once we were happy
      with the direction, the illustrations were handed off to Julia who took over as lead visual designer and
      illustrator. The images were vectorized and outfitted the mark with typography and the branding was finalized.</p>

    <h2>Experience Design</h2>
    <p>Our next goal was simple: to research Waterloo’s current website, and make improvements to encourage visitors to
      reach out, connect, and get help.</p>

    <h2>Some of those challenges included:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create unambiguous navigation to find pertinent information</li>
      <li>Make it easier to donate</li>
      <li>Encourage participation in upcoming events</li>
      <li>Improve visibility of contact information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I worked collectively with Danielle B. on the strategy and UX research. We set out to create a simple layout with
      a clear hierarchy that sat on a mobile first grid. This would allow us to create an accessible and encouraging
      online experience.</p>

    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>Starting with a heuristic evaluation of Waterloo's existing website, we examined and rated its compliance with
      usability principles. From here, we performed a study of competitors’ websites and interface elements to identify
      key areas of improvements followed by a content audit. We scrutinized the entire website, constructing an outline
      of the information architecture to better define the hierarchy. This left us with an improved sitemap and overall
      structure which created a more effective, usable experience.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>We brainstormed the site structure by beginning at the white board to explore the main layout and functionality.
      We moved into creating wireframes in Adobe Illustrator on top of bootstrap's responsive grid, as it is one of the
      most popular HTML, CSS, and JS frameworks for developing mobile first projects on the web.</p>
    <p>By wire framing, we were allowed to focus on the content and user flows without being distracted by color schemes
      and font families.</p>

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>We handed completed wireframes off to the visual designers, where finalized mockups and UI Kits were packaged up
      and delivered to the engineer on the project. Because of my development background, I worked jointly with Brian to
      assist him and provide fully optimized images in .JPGs, .PNGs, and vector .SVG formats.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The client loved the simple logo mark, stating it was a perfect representation of their message. Alternate
      versions support many layout options. An updated color strategy based on psychological influences will be used for
      future print collateral and web updates. Style guides provide them standards to keep their brand and typography
      consistent moving forward.</p>
