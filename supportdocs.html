      <p>
        Rackspace Technology customers need to have the flexibility to look for
        support documentation to maintain their infrastructure. Our solution
        should deliver an easy way for customers to share and find relevant
        documentation to determine if they will administer the task themselves
        before contacting Rackspace Support.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contributors</h2>
      <p>
        I led the design team efforts where I collaborated and worked with 2
        designers, 1 researcher, 3 content editors and 2 engineers. Helping to
        discover the real problem(s), develop strategy, create assets and
        deliver the overall concept to improve the experience.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Our support documentation pages lacked platform and visual consistency.
        Additionally, it carried with it ineffective wayfinding and poor search
        capabilities among other things.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        A newly informative single support docs website to help customers find,
        trouble shoot, discover and stay up to date on the latest news around
        the technology they use.
      </p>

      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted interviews, performed heuristic and competitive analysis to
        understand pain points our customers faced when looking for support
        documentation. Here are the key takeaways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two navigation structures</li>
        <li>Terminology varies site-to-site</li>
        <li>Inconsistent visual design</li>
        <li>Inconsistent interaction design</li>
        <li>Poor Search capabilities</li>
        <li>Ineffective wayfinding</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        These insights made us aware that our customers were extremely confused
        and we needed to make it easier for them to find, search, and get the
        information they were looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our research and content teams worked diligently to remodel the
        information architecture, nomenclature and categorization of products
        and services. Meanwhile, the design team dove deep into heuristic
        evaluations, navigation, footer and competitive analysis.

      <p>
        Through this process, we discovered that we need to provide the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search & Results</li>
        <li>Clear Categories of Documentation</li>
        <li>Usage of visuals to break up content</li>
        <li>Use of left navigation to display documentation</li>
        <li>Feedback mechanism within the page of the article</li>
        <li>Usage of a right column for additional information and actions</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs for wayfinding</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>

      <h2>Explore</h2>
      <p>
        With organized information architecture and product categorization our
        team was ready to discuss and explore. We started with user stories to
        guide our design decisions and it gets exciting.
      </p>

          As a Rackspace Technology customer, I want to be able to try solving
          problems on my own so that I do not have to contact Rackspace Support.

        <li>
          As a user, I want to know what are the tasks I can comfortably do on
          my own so that I do not have to contact support.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a developer, I want to be able to find API documentation and SDKs
          so that I can learn how to set up my environment with Rackspace
          Technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a Rackspace customer, I want to read articles from experts in the
          industry so that I can advance my technical skills.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This gave us the confidence to begin creating wireframes and low
        fidelity concepts of how a newly imagined experience could look like.

      <h2>Testing & Validation</h2>
      <p>
        We tested our concepts internally with our research and content groups,
        along with a couple designers with no direct relationship to the
        project. Reactions were mostly positive and we were able to take
        feedback and apply updates quickly and effectively.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The validation let us know we could get started on the redesign.
        Starting with the basic and primary pages to quickly handoff to
        developers so that they could begin. High fidelity design work was
        delivered via Abstract. Design efforts were then distributed to remake
        Technical Docs, Expert Insights, Responsive Navigation Menu, and Search.

        At every step, I would communicate and schedule demo reviews with
        engineers to ensure designs were implemented to spec. Very positive and
        healthy design/developer relationship that I’ve been a part of.

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The rollout of a new Support Docs site now aligns to the Rackspace
        Technology brand, consolidating top level navigation and footers.
        Utilizing a framework throughout the site for consistency allowing
        topics to be more visible as the user navigates. We’ve included helpful
        wayfinding mechanisms, consistent branding and improved search & search
        results.
