    <p>eCommission provides residential and commercial real estate agents with advance payment of commissions prior to
      their scheduled closing date. My role was to improve the overall user experience and visual identity of their web
      presence in what is otherwise an outdated ecosystem of real estate products provided by competitors.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>In efforts to avoid delays when an agent or broker submits an application, eCommission customers need a tool that
      will allow them to understand the current funding status and next steps. Additionally, account managers experience
      heightened phone and email traffic specifically related to pending application status.</p>

      <figcaption>A look at my initial brain dump documentation once we discovered a need to develop a status tool.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Increase customer satisfaction by providing on-demand insight and status updates, accelerated wire transfer
      transaction times, as well as, reduce business operation cost by customers viewing their funding status online.
      Lastly, fund more deals!</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>During this phase, a short and focused survey was emailed to customers who were qualified for new deals, in
      addition to those who funded within the last 60-90 days. I also interviewed support team members to further
      understand the problem from their point of view. This allowed me to gather an abundance of information quickly
      with no budget.</p>
    <p>From there, I combined all my findings from a sample into key insights that I would use to understand the basic
      user needs and rank their concerns.</p>

      <figcaption>Survey results of ~135 respondents granting us deeper insight to most urgent concerns.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>It is important for agents to have timely alert and notification communications when all parties have signed
        the advance agreement, as well as, when funding has been approved</li>
      <li>Brokers and agents alike want clear visibility into when (date/time) they could expect to have their funds
        deposited by wire transfer into their checking accounts</li>
      <li>On-demand access to a single access point to gain visibility into the current funding status and where it is
        at in the process</li>
      <li>Provide instructions and expectations upfront when an agent will need assistance from their broker or title
        company in order to be proactive in providing that information timely</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>I crafted two user personas to comprehend the needs desired from such a tool our team is committed to develop.
      Meet Tami, a newer agent who is looking for stability having just switched careers 3 years ago. And of course,
      Winston, an accomplished agent with years of experience whom is extremely busy and accustomed to special
      treatment.</p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>To build the right tool, I wanted to see what current design patterns exist. I looked into financial
      institutions before turning my focus to indirect competitors such as retail fashion, furniture, freight and food
      delivery services. Gathering this much inspiration and ideas excite me and begin sketching potential solutions.

    </figure>

    <h2>Sketches</h2>
    <p>I performed several rounds of sketching to quickly iterate over concepts. I present and share the sketches and
      communicate my initial thoughts with stakeholders. Here, we literally sit in a room, look at the sketches,
      distribute feedback to collectively agree and vote on a direction together.</p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>Fully armed with knowledge, user flows, features requirements and project scope I explore the visual design
      direction. Establishing a minimal interface design that aligns to our brand. More context and insight into what
      is happening and what is needed during this process is vital so I continue to iterate as the interface evolves.
    </p>
    <p>For the sake of efficiency, I created a UI style guide for use in development to keep me from having to swap
      back & forth between design and code software to color pick hex values or memorizing font weights.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Development begins with the individual components in order to write clean, legible and maintainable code. Take
      a look at some of that concept work, <a class="link" href="https://codepen.io/collection/nNgJgO/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>...and because I am OCD I do stuff like this =)</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Agents and brokers can successfully view their advance status dashboard by accessing a link that will be sent
      immediately via text to their cell phone number upon creating a new contract with eCommission. This same URL is
      provided in their confirmation email and is accessible by logging into their account online.</p>

    <h2>Single Property</h2>
    <p>Agents with a single property can quickly see all their advance details and current status. Live chat with all
      important reference information is available at a glance incase customers need further assistance.</p>

    <h2>Multiple Properties</h2>
    <p>Often times, an agent might have two or more pending sales in progress at the same time. Those customers can
      view advance status progress of those deals by selecting the street address they’d like to see.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I loved working on this project and very grateful to the folks at eCommission for not only this specific
      opportunity but also for allowing me creative freedom and allowing me to do a ton of work I am proud of for
      their company.</p>
    <p>This was one of the many highlights of my time at eCommission. It was a chance to work on something that could
      be incredibly impactful and hopefully provided great return in value for both the business and the agents that
      depend on their service.</p>
