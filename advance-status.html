    <p>eCommission provides residential and commercial real estate agents with advance payment of commissions prior to their scheduled closing date. My role was to improve the overall user experience and visual identity of their web presence in what is otherwise an outdated ecosystem of real estate products provided by competitors.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>In efforts to avoid delays when an agent or broker submits an application, eCommission customers need a tool that will allow them to understand the current funding status and next steps, if necessary. Account managers experience heightened traffic through phone, email, and chat channels specifically related to pending application status.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Increase customer satisfaction by providing on-demand insight and status updates, accelerated wire transfer transaction times, as well as, reduce business operation cost by customers viewing their funding status online. Lastly, fund more deals!</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>During this phase, the marketing team conducted research with a survey to customers who were qualified for new deals, as well as, customers who had funded within the last 60-90 days. I also spoke to our support team to analyze chat logs, emails and listen to the feedback that they receive on a daily basis. From there, I grouped all my findings into themes and high-level insights.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>It is important for agents to have timely alert and notification communications when all parties have signed the advance agreement, as well as, when funding has been approved</li>
        <li>Brokers and agents alike want clear visibility into when (date/time) they could expect to have their funds deposited by wire transfer into their checking accounts.</li>
        <li>On-demand access to a single access point to gain visibility into the current funding status and where it is at in the process.</li>
        <li>Provide instructions and expectations upfront when an agent will need assistance from their broker or title company in order to be proactive in providing that information timely.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>To build the ideal solution, I looked into other financial institutions before turning my focus to indirect competitors such as retail fashion, furniture, freight and food delivery services.</p>

    <p>I was immediately intrigued by Domino’s pizza real-time activity tracker. After inspecting how this feature works (by ordering lots of thin crust pizza) I began to feel this was a solution we could learn from.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>I crafted two user personas to guide the design process. Meet Tami, a newer agent who is looking for stability having just switched careers 3 years ago. And of course, Winston, an accomplished agent with years of experience whom is extremely busy and accustomed to special treatment.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Sketches</h3>
    <p>After several rounds of sketching the President, CEO, IT & Marketing Directors all voted on the proposed design solutions. Together, we continued to refine the type of data that would be important to include throughout the duration of the project.</p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>Once user flows, features and project scope were in place I focused on the visual design strategy. The overall inspiration was a minimalistic and modern aesthetic based on the existing color and branding guidelines we currently had in place.</p>

    <p>We quickly aligned on the visual design vision.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>I started developing the components individually so that I could write clean, legible and maintainable code. Take a look at some of that concept work, <a class="link"  href="https://codepen.io/collection/nNgJgO/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>...and because I am OCD I do stuff like this =)</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Agents and brokers can successfully view their advance status dashboard by accessing a link that will be sent immediately via text to their cell phone number upon creating a new contract with eCommission. This same URL is provided in their confirmation email and is accessible by logging into their account online.</p>

    <h3>Single Property</h3>
    <p>Agents with a single property can quickly see all their advance details and current status. Live chat with all important reference information is available at a glance incase customers need further assistance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Multiple Properties</h3>
    <p>Often times, an agent might have two or more pending sales in progress at the same time. Those customers can view advance status progress of those deals by selecting the street address they’d like to see.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>I loved working on this project and very grateful to the folks at eCommission for not only this specific opportunity but also for allowing me creative freedom and allowing me to do a ton of work I am proud of for their company.</p>
    <p>This was one of the many highlights of my time at eCommission. It was a chance to work on something that I could be incredibly impactful and hopefully provided great return in value for both the business and the agents that depend on their service.</p>
