    </ul>

    <p>In the fall of 2018 I partnered with Taxi Driver to redesign their mobile iOS application. The goal of this
      project was to deliver a visual design language based on a live prototype as a part of their introduction into the
      rideshare market.</p>
    <p>I lead the visual design while working alongside the project manager and creative director for the company. To
      begin, I was provided the following:</p>
    <ul class="margin-bottom__2">
      <li>Project brief</li>
      <li>Brand guidelines (logos, color, typography, fonts)</li>
      <li>Wireframes</li>
      <li>Design assets (logos, icons)</li>
      <li>Design Inspiration Examples</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, I had a few technical restraints to obey:</p>
    <ul class="margin-bottom__2">
      <li>App structure (for the most part) must stay in place</li>
      <li>Brand guidelines adoption</li>
      <li>Deliverables must be iOS 8</li>
      <li>Use native device font family</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The team gave me full creative freedom to experiment and interpret the references they provided, as well as,
      being very understanding in my thoughts regarding Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and mobile best practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Exploration</h2>
    <p>The design direction was influenced greatly by the brand guidelines and the examples they provided to me. I also
      analyzed other apps similar to the athestitc that they were looking for. Furthermore, I familiarizing myself with
      apps like Lyft and Uber by taking rides to better understand the interface, interactions and casually speaking
      with drivers about what they liked and disliked about the driver apps they used to earn extra money.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>Sketch is one of the most popular and sturdy UI design software products available today. Stakeholders of this
      project had access to this tool. Also, symbols are a powerful feature in Sketch. Having editable variations of
      text styles and elements made Sketch the right tool for us.</p>

    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p>Choice of colors were based on the pallet provided to me at the start of this project. Orange is a very exciting
      and enthusiastic hue that gives this product permission to be a little fun. Aside from orange, the brand had a
      wide pallet that I needed to simplify to prevent clashing and maintain balance. To avoid an overly flat design I
      made the decision to introduce an additional tinted orange hue to establish a gradient color swatch.</p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>Like most brand guidelines, Taxi Driver employed font families specific to their brand. However, we decided that
      native fonts provided many benefits. In this specific case, leveraging iOS system font San Francisco. Some of the
      benefits that made this exciting are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster loading times</li>
      <li>Extremely legible</li>
      <li>Optimizes type dynamically</li>
      <li>Supports alternate languages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Product Design</h2>
    <p>My goal here was not just design a beautiful interface, but to create an aesthetic pleasing product that helps
      improve the user experience. Because I had constraints to keep the structure of the application intact I thought
      it was important to give elements visual contrast, increase white space, convey depth and adjust proximity of
      components. This is important for the human eye to locate what is important and show emphasis.</p>

    <h2>UI Elements</h2>
    <p>To aid the user in navigating through the product I designed the interface elements to align to human interface
      guidelines, as well as, developing a library of symbols to keep the patterns and components consistent.</p>

    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>This was a bright and challenging project that follows me taking unenthusiastic mockups and transforming them
      into a competitive and attractive product interface that required well thought out rational in efforts to excite
      and improve the experience for riders and drivers alike.</p>
    <p>While an improvement, I would have liked to spend a little more time on the typography styles. I could have made
      better use of typographic hierarchy, along with, better color assignments to those fonts. The usage of the primary
      color orange also should be reduced.</p>
    <p>I successfully delivered a total of 69 views for a MVP driver and rider mobile application. I eagerly look
      forward to hearing how the product has been received thus far and hopefully seeing it released to the App Store
      one day.</p>
