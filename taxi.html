<section>
    <p>In the fall of 2018 I partnered with Taxi Driver to redesign their iOS app. The goal was to refresh the look and feel as a part of their introduction to the market. At the end of this project, I should have successfully executed and delivered on the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Identity -</span> Introduce a modern and professional visual design language that could be modular and scale overtime as new features are rolled out and application matures.</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Captivate -</span> Invoke excitement in users, especially first time users who become intrigued enough to make them want to stop, download and give this app a try.</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Ambitious -</span> Create an impactful visual hierarchy that allows users to focus most of their attention on elements with the most value to catch a ride.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Technical Restraints</h3>
    <p>Honestly, just a couple hard and fast rules I had to abide by. The team was super friendly and open to suggestions based on experience, mental models and best practices.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>App structure (for the most part) must stay in place</li>
        <li>Deliverables must be iOS 8</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

<section>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>The team of Creative Director and Engineers provided me with a ton of assets that included style guides, iconography and screenshots of the app prototype they semi-designed, built and tested. After conversations in regards to user flows and core features I was ready to begin the initial UI concepts.</p>

<section>
    <p>First, I analyzed the provided mockups and determined the best method to kickoff this project would be to follow standard design principles and heuristic guidelines. Increase negative space around objects providing more elements emphasis while minimizing focus of others. Also, standardizing color and typography relationships and reducing the number of component combinations to create more consistent UI patterns.</p>

<section>
    <p>I began with a handful of main UI views to generate conversation and recognize the direction from a high level. The more we got excited the more screens were introduced and the quicker the design begins to ramp up. Every element was built as a sketch component that eventually forms a living design system.</p>

<section>
    <p>Once the team was happy with the proposed visual design direction I documented color and typography styles. Due to the restraints of having to use a single font-family and the great work providing color profiles earlier, this was quick and easy assignment.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Obviously, Lyft and Uber. However, I didnâ€™t keep it strictly to the competitive marketplace they were in. I also absorbed other influences from other apps like Hotel Tonight, Lime and Hopper.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>I experimented with varying design styles, flat, gradient and drop shadows to bring the applications overall look and feel to life. Meticulously created components to accompany a well balanced layout.</p>

    <p>The interface was thoughtfully clean and simple yet fully adhering to the structure and foundation that was already in place. This approach now gives a fun and unique interface to riders through the use of heavily rounded corners, vibrant gradients, whitespace and lovely icons.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>The app was received well from within the company. While it has not been released I learned that open and clear communication with project managers and engineering teams early and often really helps keep the project moving smoothly.</p>
