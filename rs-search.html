      <p>
        The ability to search and filter support tickets are one of the key
        functionalities for a majority of the help desk and support products.
        Usable search mechanisms help users find valuable information in a sea
        of data so that they feel in control.
      </p>

      <p>
        As common and natural as it is to have search functionality available to
        users, sometimes we lack consistency and conditions that actually make a
        feature usable.
      </p>

      <p>
        To provide a predictable and consistent experience familiar to users we
        decided to redesign our mobile applications search & filtering
        experience.
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Role:</span> Lead Experience &amp; Interface
          Designer
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Platforms:</span> Mobile Android &amp; iOS
        </li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Date:</span> February 2019</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The approach customers expect to search and filter for tickets did not
        perform accurately to their mental models. This made their search
        experience ineffective and meaningless.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        To fully understand the issues and observe the behavior of the existing
        design from a user perspective, our research team invited and conducted
        twelve (12) interview sessions with real Rackspace customers.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ticketing status worked independently of search</li>
        <li>
          Guided search forced users into a key/value approach they were
          unfamiliar with
        </li>
        <li>
          Results are presented in pills which proved bulky and cumbersome
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Make ‘Open’ tickets the default</li>
        <li>Reduce ticketing categories and topics</li>
        <li>Consistency between Ticketing & Notifications</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Defining types of data to search & filter</h2>
      <p>
        The first step to creating an improved search experience was to
        understand the types of data available in the product.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Status</span> shows all tickets with an Open,
          Closed or View All status
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Accounts</span> include only the accounts
          selected by the user
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Classification</span> refines results to
          include Incident, Change, Service Request or All ticket types
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Severity</span> sorts tickets based on Low,
          Normal, High, Urgent or All priorities
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-bold">Date</span> includes all dates and is
          specified by using a date picker
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Defining data types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Search</span> - string input</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Status</span> - Radio Button</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Accounts</span> - Checkbox List</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Classification</span> - Radio Button</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Severity</span> - Radio Button</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">Date</span> - Date Picker</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conceptualizing Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        Next, was to start taking the research insights and recommendations to
        visually implement a search filter experience that increases our
        customer’s productivity. Providing a free form text search made more
        sense to our customers, so most of the challenge here was how to handle
        the filtering mechanism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below you can see a few different ideas and iterations of these ideas to
        allow the customers ease to filter their tickets based on the different
        types of data, in addition to, free form search queries.

      <h2>Search & Filter</h2>
      <p>
        The ability to apply and clear filters are displayed in a dialog window
        to allow customers a dedicated space to specify their preferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, we designed a fully functioning search and filtering
        experience that helps users find tickets more efficiently.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        As a result, we designed a fully functioning search and filtering
        experience that helps users find tickets more efficiently.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created clear guidelines of which types of data can be filtered</li>
        <li>
          Allows for typing keywords and strings that users identify tickets by
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented a consistent design pattern that can be consumed by other
          parts of the application
        </li>
      </ul>
